  <p>The HyperText Markup Language or HTML is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. 
   It can be assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript.
<i>Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents into multimedia web pages.</i>
 <u> HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for the appearance of the document.</u>
HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML constructs, images and other objects such as interactive forms may be embedded into the rendered page. HTML provides a means to create structured documents by denoting structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes and other items.
<em> HTML elements are delineated by tags, written using angle brackets. </em>
  <hr> Tags such as input and image tag. directly introduce content into the page.
  Other tags such as <p> surround and provide information about document text and may include other tags as sub-elements. </hr>
 Browsers do not display the HTML tags but use them to interpret the content of the page.<br> <br>
  <br>
<strong>HTML can embed programs written in a scripting language such as JavaScript, which affects the behavior and content of web pages.</strong>
  Inclusion of CSS defines the look and layout of content.</p>
